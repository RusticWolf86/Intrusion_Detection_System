# Intrusion_Detection_System

## Project Description

**Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning Classifiers**

This repository contains the comprehensive code and resources for a summer internship project focused on developing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning classifiers. The primary objective of the project was to build a robust system capable of detecting anomalous network behavior and accurately distinguishing it from normal network activities. To achieve this, a diverse and challenging dataset obtained from Kaggle was utilized, simulating a military network environment with various types of intrusions.

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The project began with thorough data preprocessing to ensure the dataset's quality and prepare it for model training. Standardization of numeric features and encoding of categorical features were performed to facilitate effective learning by machine learning classifiers.

2. **Feature Selection:** Feature selection techniques were employed to identify the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality and enhancing the models' accuracy. This step helped avoid overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the classifiers.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Multiple machine learning classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, were evaluated. Cross-validation was employed to obtain unbiased estimates of each model's performance and determine the best-performing classifier.

4. **Model Predictions:** The selected classifiers were utilized to make predictions on unseen test data. The accuracy of these predictions was assessed, and the models' performance was analyzed on previously unseen instances to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

5. **Comparison and Visualization:** The results of each model's predictions were visually compared and analyzed. The project aimed to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier, guiding the selection of the most suitable model for intrusion detection.
